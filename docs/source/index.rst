Welcome to SAGA's documentation
===============================

**SAGA** is a dual Python and C++ project for performing **Spin Asymmetry Generic Analyses**.  It uses
`ROOT <https://root.cern.ch>`_'s RDataFrame structure to read your data from ROOT TTrees and ROOT's
RooFit libraries to perform invariant mass signal and background fits and the asymmetry fits.  The
project provides background correction via sideband subtraction or sPlots and has many other useful
functionalities for running your spin asymmetry analysis.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
